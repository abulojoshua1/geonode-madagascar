### To enable the OCA app inside a geonode-project (3.x), follow the steps below

- Add the oca app in geonodes installed apps as shown below
```
INSTALLED_APPS += ([... other_apps], 'oca')
```

- Create a route for the OCA index page
```
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

from geonode.urls import urlpatterns
from oca import HomePage

urlpatterns += [
## include your urls here

]

urlpatterns = [
   url(r'^/?$', HomePage.as_view(), name='home'),
 ] + urlpatterns
```

>**Note**: The home page template (`site_index.html`) generated during the creation of the geonode project should be renamed/deleted to prevent a conflict with a template of similar naming in the OCA Django app.
